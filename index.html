		<p class="intro">Thank you for visiting our home page! If you haven't been to Splash pool before, please refer to our prices and schedule links to find out when you can visit and how much it will cost. Our pool is conventiently located in the downtown area and has plenty to offer for all age groups. There is a 50 meter pool with a shollow and deep end, perfect for doing laps. We also offer a 25 meter pool for those looking for a more relaxed environment. For kids we have a kiddie pool, shallow and safe for the younger crowd. There is also a swirl pool for recreation. Check out our schedule to see when the various pools are open to ensure the best time during your visit. If you are inexperienced swimmer, that's ok too because we have a minimum of 5 life guards on duty at all times for your safety. Additionally, we offer private swimming lessons which you can find out more about in the Ottawa Recreation Guide.</p>
